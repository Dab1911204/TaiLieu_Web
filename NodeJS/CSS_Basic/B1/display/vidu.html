        Your morning eyes, I could stare like watching stars <span class = "display-none">Display-None 1</span>
        <span class = "display-none">Display-None 2</span> I could walk you by, and I'll tell without a thought
        You'd be the one, and I won't need no one else
        But I know it's just a dream that I can't help
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll imagine we fell in love <span class = "inline">Inline 1</span>
        <span class = "inline">Inline 2</span> In a world where it's just us
        But it's only in my mind
        'Cause in real life, you're not mine 
    </p>
    <p>
        Every time I see your face, I feel the blue <span class = "block">Block 1</span>
        <span class = "block">Block 2</span> Like the ocean deep and true
        But I know I can't reach you
        So I paint my skies in blue
    </p>
    <p class = "visibility-hidden">
        Maybe one day you'll see
        The colors you bring to me
        But until that day is true
        I'll keep dreaming in blue
    </p>
    <p>
        Maybe one day you'll see <span class = "inline-block">Inline-Block 1</span>
        <span class = "inline-block">Inline-Block 2</span> The colors you bring to me
        But until that day is true
        I'll keep dreaming in blue
    </p>
